            <li>Sautee shrimp – Add shrimp and sautee in a single layer for `1 minute, flip and cook another minute until opaque and pink then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Return steaks to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Turn the steaks to coat and spoon more flavored butter over them. Serve and enjoy.</li>
