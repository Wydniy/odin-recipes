    <h2>Description</h2>
    <text>Shrimp Alfredo is one of my favorite dishes to eat. It dosent take too long to cook and it's a popular dish in America. 
    Shrimp Alfredo can be made any type of way but i like mine buttery and extra creamy with a buscuit. </text>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups butter, divided</li>

            <li>3/4 cup grated cheese</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed, divided</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm.</li>
            <li>While the fettuccine is cooking, heat 1 cup butter and cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add Romano, Parmesan, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>At the same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. When butter melts, add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Fold shrimp mixture into sauce. Add drained fettuccine and toss to coat.</li>
